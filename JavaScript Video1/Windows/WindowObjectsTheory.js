//Window 

//Window is the main container, or we can say the global Object and any operations related to entire browser 
// window can be a part of window object

//All the members like objects, methods or properties .If they are the part of window object, then we do not 
//refer the window object



//Document

//1:DOM is the child of window object

//2:In the DOM we need to refer the documenet, if we want to use the document object , methods or properties

//3:Document is just the object of the global object that is Window, which deals with the document of HTML elements themselves

// ------------------>>Window Object :
// The window object represents the global window in a browser.Both Browser Object Model(BOM) & Documenet Object model(DOM)
// are the part of the window object 


//BOM:The BOM represents the browser as an object and provides methods and properties for intereacting with the browser
//itself(not directly related to the content of the web page).

//EG: BOM features include window.navigator for browser navigation information , window.location for URL manipulation etc




//DOM:The DOM represents the structured document as a tree of objects , where each object corresponds to a part of
//the document (such as elements , attributes , and text).
//DOM is focused on the content of the page , the BOM is focused on the browser Environment
